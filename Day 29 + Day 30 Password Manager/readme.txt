Simple password manager with an interface.

Provide website/app name, username/email used and it will generate a random password.
Password is added to the clipboard right away for immediate use, and stored in the data.json.
Search function also included, provide the name of the app/website as you entered it initially and it will provide the username/password if one is available.
