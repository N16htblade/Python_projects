Project skipped due to Tinder requiring real phone to authenticate account.

Project requirements:
- open Tinder in Chrome
- using Selenium provide LogIn thru Facebook sign-in
- click Like button (Simulate swipe right) on each presented profile until daily limit reach
    - if Match event triggers, close event and resume clicking on Like
